### 1. Core Pipeline Architecture

The primary logic is implemented in `run_all_models.py` via the `MedicalAIPipeline` class. It integrates multiple AI models to perform comprehensive patient analysis and treatment recommendations.

#### A. Multi-Modal Input Processing

##### Image Analysis
- Inputs chest X-ray images
- Uses a DenseNet121 model with attention mechanisms
- Performs multi-label classification for 13 lung diseases
- Implementation: `train_chexagent_model.py` and related files

##### Text Analysis

- Performs multi-label classification matching image model's outputs
- Includes a fallback keyword-matching system

##### Tabular Data Analysis
- **Diabetes**: XGBoost model on 21 features

- **Heart Disease**: MLP classifier using clinical inputs
- All provide binary classification (Yes/No) with probability outputs

#### B. Model Integration

##### Disease Detection Fusion
- Merges predictions from image and text models
- Resolves conflicts using confidence scores

##### Risk Assessment
- Combines heart, kidney, and diabetes results
- Builds a complete comorbidity risk profile

#### C. LLM Integration

### 2. LLM Fusion Strategy

The LLM layer acts as a high-level decision-making system that:

#### Aggregates Outputs
- Integrates predictions from image, text, and tabular models
- Utilizes confidence scores to balance conflicting results

#### Contextual Reasoning
- Analyzes relations between multiple diseases
- Evaluates risks posed by comorbidities like diabetes, heart, and kidney disease

#### Medical Knowledge Application
- Applies clinical logic to suggest compatible treatments
- Highlights drug contraindications based on comorbidity status
- Adjusts or recommends alternative medications accordingly

#### Final Decision Support
- Prioritizes treatment based on severity
- Balances multiple therapies to avoid medical conflict
- Produces a holistic treatment recommendation plan
